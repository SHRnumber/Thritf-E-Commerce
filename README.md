*A static e-commerce prototype for a thrift clothing store.*

**Live Demo:** [https://melodic-paletas-932da8.netlify.app/](https://melodic-paletas-932da8.netlify.app/)

A **frontend-only** e-commerce website built purely with HTML, CSS (W3.CSS framework), and minimal JavaScript for interactivity. This project serves as a responsive UI template for a thrift store, featuring product listings, a sidebar navigation, and mock functionality.

## Key Features
- **Static Product Pages**: Displays jeans collection with prices and labels (e.g., "New", "Sale").
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop using W3.CSS.
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Accordion menu for product categories (Jeans).
  - Newsletter subscription modal (frontend-only).
  - Hover effects on product images.
- **Contact Form**: Placeholder form (no backend processing).

## Limitations
- **No Backend**: All buttons/forms are static (no cart, payments, or data storage).
- **Hardcoded Data**: Products are manually added in HTML.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **W3.CSS**: Pre-built responsive styles.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for social media/cart.
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Montserrat, Roboto).

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Why This Project?
- **Learning Focus**: Ideal for beginners to understand HTML/CSS layouts.
- **Template**: Use as a starting point to add backend (e.g., Node.js, Firebase).

## Future Ideas (If Expanded)
- Add JavaScript cart functionality.
- Integrate a backend for real products/users.
- Dynamic product loading via API.
